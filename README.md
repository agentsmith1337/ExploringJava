## Java Repository
### Scope
This repository is limited to Java SE, and everything that can be done with it. 
GUI with JavaFX is also covered in limited capacity as it is not industry standard anymore.
In the modern programming landscape, Java serves major developmental initiatives across platforms, 
from Desktop and Web to Android. Though it is now being replaced in newer ventures, 
It's legacy is impractical to replace. 
### Structure 
I have built up from the bare basics, as Java is an extremely modular language and each module counts when programming in Java. You can not expect to forget a method name and implement it ad-hoc midway as with C/C++ System Level languages. (You actually can, but it doesnt look "clean", and worse off, defeats the purpose of a modular OOP language.)
#### Navigation
This will be updated as the repository goes on. Currently it only has simple algorithmic programmes. 
#### Timeline
